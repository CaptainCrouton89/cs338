        <h1>A network tools scavenger hunt</h1>
		<p>File: misc/tools.txt</p>

        <p><em>You may work with other people on this assignment, but write up and submit your own solutions.</em></p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Get comfortable messing around on the Unix command line</li>
            <li>Use some networking vocabulary: host, IP address, port,...</li>
            <li>Learn some basics about the wide range of available networking commands</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rubric</h2>
        <div class="code">1 - author name at the top of misc/tools.txt
1 * 9 - the questions
2 - citations</div>

        <h2>Your job</h2>
        <p>This is a short-answer assignment, so keep it brief&mdash;just a list of commands should be sufficient
		for most of the questions.</p>

        <p>For each of the following, provide at least one Unix command that
        answers the question. Make sure these commands work in either the macOS Terminal,
		the WSL terminal on Windows, or the terminal on our Kali virtual machine.
		I'm not interested (today) in answers that involve GUI programs, so restrict your answers to
		command-line commands.</p>

		<p>You'll need to have some familiarity with some beginning concepts
		related to IP (addresses), TCP (ports), and HTTP (headers). So you should watch
		my video <a href="https://carleton.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c7e0aa36-5891-41f4-bb8f-ac1c00fb2170">A brief introduction to HTTP</a> before jumping into those questions. (I know that
        some of you already know this stuff, but the video might be useful just to learn how
        I think about this material. Of course, those of you who have watched this video
        before shouldn't feel obligated to do it again.)</p>

        <p>Go ahead and use whatever internet resources you find, but <strong>cite your sources</strong>
        for each problem. For this assignment, an URL is sufficient citation.
        Ultimately, the answers are in each command's documentation, no matter how you found the
        command in the first place, but (1) I'd love to have links to resources you found useful,
        and (2) I want you to get into the habit of citing your sources for this class.</p>

		<h2>How to hand it in</h2>
		<p>In your GitHub repository for this course, put your answers in a text file
        named <em>tools.txt</em> in the <em>misc</em> directory you created during the
        <a href="00-setup.html">setup assignment</a>.
		I really do want this to be a text file (not PDF, not .docx, not .rtf, etc.).
		When you're ready, git add/commit/push to put your answers into the GitHub copy of your repository.</p>

		<h2>The questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What's your computer's IP address for its current Internet connection?
                (0-point bonus: how can you tell the difference between your Ethernet IP and your
                wireless IP if you have both connections active?)</li>
            <li>How can you determine the IP address associated with a given host name?</li>
            <li>How can you determine the host name(s) associated with a given IP address?</li>
            <li>How can you copy a file from one computer to another? Or more to the point, if you
                create a file on the Kali virtual machine and you want to put it someplace where you
                can save it, like your your account on mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu, how do you
                go about it from the Kali command-line interface?</li>
            <li>How can you tell whether there's a process listening on a given port (e.g. port 80
                or port 22) on a given host?</li>
            <li>How can you tell which ports have processes listening on them on a given host?</li>
            <li>How can you retrieve and save a given web page (say https://google.com/ or https://carleton.edu/)
                in a file on your system?</li>
            <li>How can you view the HTTP headers sent back from a specified web server when
                you request one of its pages?</li>
            <li>How can you view the HTTP headers that <em>your</em> computer sends <em>to</em> the web server when you
                do the tasks in the previous two questions?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some commands that you might find interesting: nc (also known as netcat), nmap, curl, wget.
            There are other relevant commands, of course, so use your internet-searching powers.</p>
