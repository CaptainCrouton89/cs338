Noteâ€”all messages may be encoded using base64 if necessary

1. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared key K. Then, using AES, they send their messages back and forth. This works because although DH is vulnerable to Mal, a listener cannot discern the contents of the message. 


2. Alice and Bob use RSA to encrypt and decrpyt. This begins with Alice encrypting a key using bob's public key, 

M = E(P_B, K)

Then, boby decrypts the key

K = D(S_B, M)

Using this shared key, Alice sends Bob her longer messages using AES

M = AES_E(K, C)

Bob decrypts this longer messages using AES

C = AES_D(K, M)
